                <h2>Bio</h2>
            </span>
            I was born the second oldest of 9 children. I was homeschooled from birth to age 18 and my father was an
            entrepeneur. I worked for the family business producing audio-visual copies of my fathers legal training
            seminars, I also worked on the websites associated with my fathers work. I then spent some time in Detroit,
            Michigan on a mission for my church. After the mission I spent another year working for the family
            business. At the age of 20 I married my best friend who I'd met back when I was 12. I then followed her
            around for a few years while she was in the Air Force. I got a job in the oil field outside of Grand
            Junction, CO and my wife left the Air Force when we were having our first child. Now, 6 years later we've
            just had our third child and moved to West Jordan, Utah in hopes of getting finding a job that supports my
            family while also allowing me to actually spend time with my family. I've been a gamer since I could hold a
            controller and an avid reader ever since I picked up the first Animorphs book back in 1997. I also love to
            go snowboarding with my wife whenever we have time.

            <h2>Why Helio</h2>
            I chose to study with Helio Training because my work in the oil field was no longer supporting my family. I
            also feel like my intelligence was being wasted in the oil field and I was putting my physical wellbeing at
            risk as well. I heard from family members that now was a perfect time to get back into web design and make
            a career out of it. After a bit of research of my own I decided it was time to make the change and begin
            mycareer!
